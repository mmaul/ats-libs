                               ats-libs Berkeley Database Binding

DESCRIPTION:
This is a low level wrapper for the Berkely Database. This was build using 
Berkeley 4.7.5 it may work with older version. The implementation closely 
follows the Berkeley C api, See the STATS/bdb.sats for types and functions.
For interaction with the Berkley DB see the Berkeley API documentation.
For a usage example see test/bdb_test.dats.

USAGE:
For sepecific API documentation and usage instructions please refer to the files in 
the doc directory and the README file for the library you are intrested in. However
general usage is detailed below.

To include in your ats programs.
  staload "ats-libs/bdb/SATS/bdb.sats

To include the CATS files in your ats programs. (Only necessary if using in embed mode)
  %{ #include "ats-libs/bdb/DATS/bdb.cats %}

Shared and static mode
----------------------

Using libraries as shared or static generally on requires loading the static files in your 
ats programs. When building your ats program you must reference the library in your linking 
params.
Shared Example
  atscc  -o myfile  myfile.dats  -lats_bdb -ldb-4.7
Static Example
  atscc  -o myfile  myfile.dats  -static -lats_bdb -ldb-4.7

To run your program the dependent shared libraries must be in your library search path. 
You can accomplish this by adding it to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH as show below or the libraries 
can be moved to a location already on your search path.
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ATSHOME/ats_libs/bdb/lib
For specific require ments refer to the README file for the library you are intrested in.

Embeded mode
------------
To use the libraries in embeded mode the CATS and DATS files must also be included in your 
programs. Additionally any dependent libraries must be included in your linker params.For 
specific require ments refer to the README file for the library you are intrested in.
Embeded Example
   atscc  -o myfile_embeded  myfile_embeded.dats  -ldb-4.7
